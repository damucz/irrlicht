Irrlicht for Marmalade
======================

I took current [OpenGL ES branch of Irrlicht](http://sourceforge.net/p/irrlicht/code/HEAD/tree/branches/ogl-es/) (#4908), [Ricky Taylor's Marmalade patch](http://sourceforge.net/p/irrlicht/patches/254/) and update it to current Irrlicht and Marmalade.

I ported few samples (just rename mainXX.cpp to main.cpp). Most of the features works, except per vertex lighting (although per pixel lighting DO!).

However I found the Irrlicht is not what I'm searching for, so I'm abandoning it. Various reasons.

Maybe someone find it usefull to use the port, so I'm giving it to public.
